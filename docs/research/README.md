# Research Artifacts

This directory stores outputs from the Research (R) phase of the RQPIV workflow.

## Contents

Research artifacts generated by research sub-agents are stored here:

| Artifact Type | Filename Pattern | Generated By |
|---------------|------------------|--------------|
| Codebase maps | `codebase-map-{date}.md` | codebase-explorer |
| Module analysis | `module-{name}-{date}.md` | module-researcher |
| Frontend analysis | `frontend-analysis-{date}.md` | frontend-researcher |
| Backend analysis | `backend-analysis-{date}.md` | backend-researcher |
| Dependency audits | `dependency-audit-{date}.md` | dependency-researcher |
| Pattern documentation | `patterns-{date}.md` | pattern-researcher |

## Purpose

These artifacts serve multiple purposes:

1. **Context Preservation**: Keep research findings without polluting main agent context
2. **Knowledge Reuse**: Reference previous research in future sessions
3. **Team Sharing**: Share codebase understanding across team members
4. **Audit Trail**: Document what was understood before making changes

## Usage

### Reading Previous Research

Before starting new work, check for existing research:

```bash
ls docs/research/
```

### Updating Research

Research should be updated when:

- Significant codebase changes occur
- New modules or features are added
- Dependencies are updated
- Patterns change

## Retention

Research artifacts should be:

- Kept for at least the duration of the related feature work
- Archived or deleted when no longer relevant
- Updated rather than creating duplicates

## Session-Specific Research

For workflow sessions, research may also be stored in:

```
docs/sessions/{date}-{task-slug}/research/
```
